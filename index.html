<span>Greetings friends and family!</span>
<br>
<br>
<div>&emsp; Spring at Leeland Forest Farm is bustling with new life and activity.  The first round of chicks are almost ready to head out to pasture.  Pigs are rooting and resting under the newly leafed out trees, and always excited to see us coming.  
</div> 
<br>
<span> &emsp; Remember, if you have not yet pre-ordered, let us know if you would like a whole or half hog in July
 and the number of chickens you would like.  The first chickens will be available July 4th weekend.
   This is 2 weeks later than expected, because of a supply issue.  Thankfully, we are well underway now.

 <br><br />&emsp; Email me for the pricing sheet or with any questions.</span>
